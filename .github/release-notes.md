## Highlights

**Logs only keep the last run.** The engine log (`logs/BattleShip-Remix.log`) used to grow with every launch and keep up
to ten rotated copies (`BattleShip-Remix.1.log` ... `.10.log`, 10 MB each). It is now emptied at every launch, like
`ssb64.log`. The old rotated copies are no longer used and can be deleted.

The self-updaters (Android, Switch, desktop) offer this version automatically.

## Install

No game data is included: you need your own ROM.

- `baserom.remix.z64`: Smash Remix 2.0.1, made from your Super Smash Bros. NTSC-U v1.0 ROM with the
  [Smash Remix web patcher](https://smashremix.net/patcher/) (in the browser, nothing to install) or the Remix 2.0.1
  patch from the [Smash Remix releases](https://github.com/JSsixtyfour/smashremix/releases) (ROM SHA-1 `13716381ed5e29be2606e0f4724b18fd00789d04`; `.z64`, `.n64` or `.v64`).

**macOS, Linux, Windows:** run the app. On the first launch it asks for the ROM and extracts `BattleShip-Remix.o2r`
into its app data folder. The macOS app is not notarized: the first time, right-click it and choose Open (or run
`xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/BattleShip-Remix.app`).

**Nintendo Switch:** the console does not read the ROM. Run a desktop build once to extract `BattleShip-Remix.o2r`
and `BattleShip-Remix.o2r.recipe`, unzip `BattleShip-Remix-switch.zip` to the root of the SD card, copy the two files
next to `BattleShip-Remix.nro` in `sdmc:/switch/BattleShip-Remix/`, and launch it in full-memory mode (hold R while
opening an installed game). Both files must come from a desktop build of the same release as the `.nro`: the game
refuses to start if the `.recipe` is missing or does not match, and the error screen shows both recipes. When a release
changes the asset pipeline, copy the newly extracted `.o2r` and `.recipe` again.

**Android (arm64):** install `BattleShip-Remix-android.apk` (allow installs from unknown sources), open it and pick the
Smash Remix 2.0.1 ROM; it extracts `BattleShip-Remix.o2r` on the phone. It installs next to the vanilla BattleShip app.
32-bit Android (armeabi-v7a) is not shipped yet.

**PlayStation 5 (homebrew):** needs a jailbroken PS5 with ShadowMountPlus. Unzip
`BattleShip-Remix-ps5-PPSA99264.zip` to `/data/homebrew/` (or the same folder on an external drive), so the game sits
in `PPSA99264/`, copy your ROM into that folder as `baserom.remix.z64` (by FTP), and open BattleShip Remix from the
Games row. The first launch extracts `BattleShip-Remix.o2r` into the same folder (a system notification tells when it
starts and ends); saves, settings and logs stay there too. L3+R3 opens the port menu (the Create button belongs to the
system).
